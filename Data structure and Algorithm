This repository contains well-organized code implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Each folder—like LINKLIST, STACK, QUEUE, TREE, and SEARCHING—focuses on a core topic in computer science. The goal is to provide clear, testable, and easy-to-understand logic for learning and practice.
